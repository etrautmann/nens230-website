Our main go-to for questions is the [https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2015/nens230 course Piazza page]. Unless it's a private issue, we encourage you to post your questions (even logistics or 'My MATLAB won't install' questions) on Piazza, since other students may be wondering the same thing!

Otherwise, please send all course-related questions to the staff e-mail: ([nens230@gmail.com])
